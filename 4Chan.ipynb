Athenaios (12.554c-e) say that the two daughters of a relatively prosperous farmer in Siracusa (Italy), beautiful, cheerful and of sharp wit, bet one Sicilian summer evening on the beauty of their buttocks to see which of them was worthy of the first prize. For this they agreed to show it to a passerby and have him decide who was the winner</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The girls lived on the outskirts of the city, so they had to wait a long time to find the appropriate judge. At last a young man with broad shoulders and a neat tunic appeared on the slope of the road. At the precise moment when he reached where they were and saw them, Helena lifted her tunic and, smiling, looked down at her buttocks</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So when Aspasia told him about the bet and in turn showed him her own buttocks, he could no longer think of anything but Helena’s ass. Of course you voted for it. In fact, he fell in love with her, so much so that when he returned to the city he told his younger brother what had happened. The younger brother went to the outskirts of town as soon as he could to see the girls. It turns out that he fell in love with the younger sister, even long before he was lucky enough to see her bare buttocks</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The boys plead with their father to allow them to marry the girls, and the father could not deny them when he saw the girls. They married, and the girls became famous for their assets, and were called The Fair-Buttocks. Since they had become rich and famous, they founded a temple to Aphrodite in thanks, and it was dedicated to he aspect of the goddess relating to beautiful butts, and the temple was then manned only by women with beautiful rear-ends</span>', 'No of Replies': 48, '_id': ObjectId('635f3859102a9c81f44bd5d4')}\n",

In 1903, 5.6% of Polish Jews had red hair. Other studies have found that 3.69% of Jewish women overall were found to have red hair, but around 10.9% of all Jewish men have red beards. In European culture, before the 20th century, red hair was often seen as a stereotypically Jewish trait: during the Spanish Inquisition, all those with red hair were identified as Jewish. In Italy, red hair was associated with Italian Jews, and Judas was traditionally depicted as red-haired in Italian and Spanish art. The stereotype that red hair is Jewish remains in parts of Eastern Europe and Russia</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to Montague Summers, red hair and green eyes were thought to be the sign of a witch, a werewolf or a vampire during the Middle Ages:</span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Those whose hair is red, of a certain peculiar shade, are unmistakably vampires. It is significant that in ancient Egypt, as Manetho tells us, human sacrifices were offered at the grave of Osiris, and the victims were red-haired men who were burned, their ashes being scattered far and wide by winnowing-fans. It is held by some authorities that this was done to fertilize the fields and produce a bounteous harvest, red-hair symbolizing the golden wealth of the corn.

The other candidates would not be revealed for their own safety. From there, you have no idea whos fault it was if he was a good or bad politician because the voting was so obscure and there was no negative media coverage for months leading up to the election.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For what purpose?</span><br>The three benefits of this system will be starving the media of a target, removing the divisive partisanship of modern american politics, and making the vote based on agreeableness/merit instead of based on popularity or allegiance. For example, you wont just vote R or D down the ballot and have to actually decipher their answers. Furthermore candidates would have to know what they are talking about to answer 30 random questions on the fly in a satisfying manner. Finally there wont be massive shill campaigns because no one will actually know the identity of any of the candidates. Perchance, if we elect some dictator spic or some global homo paki, no one will really know who to blame and the anger will be directed towards the president instead of at his supporters or his media engine as it is now.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thoughts?</span>', 'No of Replies': 16, '_id': ObjectId('635f386a102a9c81f44bd65b')}\n",

While he was listening to Kushner and Ivanka at every turn, praising the vaccine, letting felons out of prison and pledging $500 billion to black people, the key battleground states of Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada were being rigged right under his nose. He was simply too stupid and got completely outplayed by the system, the same system he pledged to drain out, but again, he failed miserably.<br><br>I&#039;m not defending the establishment republicans either. McConnell is absolutely a cuck and an embarrassment, and it&#039;s a joke he&#039;s going to be re-elected as leader of the senate republicans. That being said, it&#039;s ABUNDANTLY clear the republican nominee for president should be Florida-themed, and it&#039;s very clearly shaping up to be DeSantis + Scott/Rubio VP (or as a smokey, Gabbard). While the Republicans were being embarrassed all over the country during the mid-terms, DeSantis showed exactly how its done, absolutely smashing his democrat opposition. Unlike Trump, he cracked down on voter fraud well in advance, combated woke shit across the state, and specifically made a point about targeting education reform. While critical race theory and transgenderism spreads across classrooms around the world like a malignant cancer, DeSantis is doing everything he can to crack down and stop it.<br><br>Just face it, DeSantis is clearly the far superior candidate to Trump right now.'}\n",

In short, he makes it more difficult to attack him with lawfare, censorship, and attacks from the Democrat-held Senate and Executive branch. <br><br>2) He is operating as a shield. One thing Trump is great at is sucking up all of the attention. In addition to this he has been through the works and is aware of how extreme the resources and attacks against any Republican candidate will be heading into 2024. As such he will put himself up to attract those attacks, thereby protecting real candidates not as well equipped for a two-year assault as they try and get up and running. As long as DJT is in the race, 70% of those resources will be directed at him. <br><br>As we get nearer the primaries or even the nominating convention, Trump will step aside, saying it is due to age or health or whatever plays best in the campaign. Even if he’s not seen as a likely winner he will have enormous political capital and will have the power to endorse the Republican candidate his bloc wants, end-running any GOPe shenanigans like a Romney or Liz Cheney ticket. <br><br>With this knowledge, please remember to support DJT for President.'}\n",
